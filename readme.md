# My First Express.js Project

Welcome to my first Express.js project! This project was created as part of my learning journey to explore Express.js, MongoDB, web cookies, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate my understanding of building web applications using Express.js, a popular Node.js web application framework. In this project, I've implemented basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality along with user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- **bcrypt**: bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed to securely hash passwords.
- **dotenv**: dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

## Features

- User authentication using JWT.
- CRUD operations for managing users.
- Secure password storage using bcrypt.
- Error handling and validation using middleware.
- RESTful API design principles.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file and specifying the required variables.
4. Start the server by running `npm start`.
5. Access the application through your browser or API client.
